# SattvicYantra

**Orchestrating Intelligent Systems**

SattvicYantra is a systems-focused technology company that designs and orchestrates intelligent pipelines, automation frameworks, and AI-driven agent systems.

We build foundational products and platforms—such as personal finance systems, backend pipeline automation, and AI agent tools—focused on structure, coordination, and long-term reliability.

Alongside products, we selectively work with partners on bespoke system design (custom AI agents, orchestration layers, automation pipelines) when such work strengthens our long-term platform vision.

SattvicYantra operates as a **parent brand** under which multiple products, internal systems, and experiments may exist.

Complex systems must be **structured to scale**.
